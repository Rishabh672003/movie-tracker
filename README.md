# Movie Tracker

This project presents a Movie Tracker Web App that allows users to add, filter, rate, and manage movies theyâ€™ve watched or plan to watch. 
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a Node.js server, the application focuses on dynamic user interaction and local storage to maintain state.
The user-friendly interface offers functionality like real-time filtering, star ratings, and status toggling between watched and unwatched.
The project is deployed on Google cloud to make it available anywhere in the world and make the website Scalable and Reliable
